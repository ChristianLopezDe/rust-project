# Notes
I modified a Login Template from here: https://freefrontend.com/css-login-forms/

Future:
Given that theres always room for improvement, with more time I'd add the following.
1. A "cash out" page. E.g. with your existing inventory, wipe it with whatever you want "Shipped" home.
2. A receipt page after making a trade. It would state what you gained from said trade, and what food was used for said trade.
3. Rely on backend for user inventory and website inventory. 
4. Minor css changes (change location of website title, adjust sizes of images, etc.)
5. Restrict a trade if not enough stock. e.g. trade for 50 watermelons, but only 20 in stock currently. Use if statement in html statement, and pass website_inv in main.rs function.
6. Hide the trading buttons if the user isn't logged in.
7. Modify existing error pages.
